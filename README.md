# LargePNet-for-fluorescence-image-restoration

This the supplementary code repository of the article "LargePNet: Large-view statistics aggregation enables finer restoration of fluorescence images"

It contains a general fluorescence image resotration models LargePNet

Its core idea is to aggregate large-view global information to improve the restoration performance. Its primary technical details are shown in the below figure.

To exert the advantages of LargePNet, it typically requires training images with a resolution of 512x512

We have explored eight representative fluorescence image restoration tasksï¼Œ all showing advantages of LargePNet over conventional small-patch-trained networks, as shonw below:
